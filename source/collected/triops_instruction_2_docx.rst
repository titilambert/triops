Triops Instructions
-------------------

You are about to embark on a biological adventure that will take you back to the 
Age of the Dinosaurs and give you weeks of enjoyment as you grow your very own "living dinosaurs!"

What You'll Need
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Small Clean Plastic or Glass Tank (1/4 - 1/2 gallon or 1-2 liters)
* 1 Liter Distilled Water and 1 Liter still mineral water with 7ph

Hatching & Growing Your TRIOPS:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

STEP 1. GETTING READY.
``````````````````````

1. You must grow Triops in a small 1/4 - 1/2 gal or 1 - 2 liter tank (clean glass or plastic).
2. Rinse tank with water prior to use (NO SOAP)
3. Fill tank with 70% DISTILLED WATER and 30% still mineral water with 7ph
4. No Tap Water (Even if it has aged or been dechlorinated - Triops will not hatch!)
5. Place tank in bright light (Preferably both artificial & natural light)
6. Monitor & maintain a temperature between 73-85F (22-29C)

.. note:: Your Triops will not hatch/grow if:

          * Any foreign objects are added to the tank
          * Water temperature is below 73 degrees
 
STEP 2.
```````

Put eggs with sand in Water. The eggs will begin to hatch in 18 - 50 hours depending on the temperature.
Make sure the eggs are floating in the water, not on top of the nutrient pack. Do not shake or disturb
your tank before the eggs are hatched. Add more distilled water to your tank on days 2 & 3.
This will wash down any unhatched eggs that are stuck to the sides.

STEP 3. FEEDING YOUR HATCHED BABY TRIOPS
````````````````````````````````````````

* Day 1 - Do not feed your Triops for the first 24 hours of life.
* Day 2 â€“ feed green algae powder (  Toothpick tip full ) 
* Day 3 - No need to feed.
* Day 4 - feed green algae powder (  Toothpick tip full )
* Days 5&6 - If Triops are consuming all their food, feed them daily. Do not add any food unless they have eaten all previous pellets; this will foul the water.
* Days 7,8&9 - Feed  uncrushed pellet for each Triops daily. If they eat the pellet in a few hours, feed another pellet.
* Day 10 - Increase feeding while insuring all food is being consumed the same day.

HELPFUL HINTS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Triops do best if placed in a combination of natural and artificial light for 12 - 16 hours per day.
* To grow large Triops, supplement their diet (2X weekly) with VERY small amounts (pellet size) of freeze dried worms or brine shrimp. This may also be done with raw carrots or fish.
* When performing a water change, use distilled water only.
* Avoid using insecticides, room sprays or cleaning fluids in the same room housing your Triops. Your tank water may absorb some of these harmful vapors and possibly poison your aquatic pets.
* Do not use flake fish food. Use a high quality pellet fish food if you should run out.
* Do not add water conditioners, dechlorinators, colored gravel or toys to your tank, these may be toxic to your Triops.
* Do not over feed. If food accumulates, reduce feedings, change water more frequently & remove excess food with a disposable eye dropper.
